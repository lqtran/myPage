			It required no explanation, just as the universe needs none as it travels through endless time. \
			What the boy felt at that moment was that he was in the presence of the only woman in his life, \
			and that, with no need for words, she recognized the same thing. ",
			
	"second": "He was more certain of it than of anything in the world. \
			He had been told by his parents and grandparents that he must fall in love \
			and really know a person before becoming committed. \
			But maybe people who felt that way had never learned the universal language.",
				
	"third": "Because, when you know that language, it's easy to understand that someone in the world awaits you, \
			whether it's in the middle of the desert or in some great city. And when two such people encounter each other, \
			and their eyes meet, the past and the future become unimportant.",
		
	"fourth": "There is only that moment, and the incredible certainty that everything under the sun has been written \
			by one hand only. It is the hand that evokes love, and creates a twin soul for every person in the world. \
			Without such love, one's dreams would have no meaning.",
